# Exercise: Making Charts With SQL and Pandas

This exercise is self-guided. You've seen a few examples of using pandas and SQL to fetch data and create charts from that data. Now, you're going to do it yourself!

Pandas has the ability to produce several kinds of charts built in. A list of all the charts, and sample code for creating them from a dataframe, can be found here: [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html)

### Repeat the following (at least) 3 times

1. Select a chart type you'd like to make.
2. Formulate a SQL query that fetches data that would be appropriate for this chart type.
3. Execute the query and produce the chart.
